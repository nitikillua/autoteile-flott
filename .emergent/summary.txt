<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initiated a series of requests. First, they asked for extensive content and keyword updates across multiple product categories (Motor, Elektrik, Karosserie, etc.) on their landing page, requiring changes in all supported languages (German, English, Hungarian, Polish). Next, they provided new manufacturer logos (IWIS, Sonax, Eurolube, etc.) and requested they be added to the appropriate categories, along with updating some existing logos (Sachs, Bosch).

The most complex request involved fixing the contact form to allow file uploads (PDFs and images). The agent first identified that the existing Formspree implementation did not support uploads on the user's plan. This led to a multi-stage backend implementation:
1.  A custom FastAPI backend endpoint was created to handle form data and file uploads.
2.  SMTP email sending was configured, first attempting to use Gmail with an app password, then switching to the user's Checkdomain SMTP server credentials when forwarding failed.
3.  After realizing this Python backend wouldn't work in the static Vercel deployment environment, the agent, following user instructions, created a Node.js-based Vercel Serverless Function to handle the mail sending.
4.  Finally, the user requested to scrap all backend and serverless implementations and revert completely to a static Formspree-based contact form.

**User's preferred language**: Deutsch

**what currently exists?**
The project is a static frontend-only React application. All textual content, including translations, is hardcoded in various JavaScript mock files within the  directory. A significant amount of content and numerous manufacturer logos were recently added or updated.

The application's backend infrastructure, which was built out to handle form submissions and file uploads via SMTP, has been completely dismantled per the user's latest request. This includes the deletion of the Vercel Serverless function files () and the removal of all email-sending logic and credentials from the Python backend (). The  component has been rewritten to use the  hook, making the application fully static again.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was in the process of reverting the contact form from a custom backend solution back to a pure Formspree implementation. This involved deleting all server-side logic and rewriting the  file to submit directly to the user's Formspree endpoint ().
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent. The test should involve filling the form, attaching a file, and submitting to verify if the Formspree integration works as expected, especially given the history of issues.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1:  (P0) Verify the reverted Formspree contact form's file upload functionality.
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The entire issue of file uploads has been a circular problem. The initial attempt with Formspree failed due to plan limitations (File Uploads Not Permitted). This led to building a custom backend, which was complex and ultimately abandoned. The current fix is reverting to the original Formspree method, which is highly likely to fail again for the same reason.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Use the frontend testing agent to attempt a form submission with a file attached.
        2. Analyze the network request to  and its response to confirm if the File Uploads Not Permitted error reoccurs.
        3. If it fails, inform the user that the issue is due to their Formspree plan limitations and that an upgrade is required for file uploads to work with Formspree.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? The contact form is the primary conversion tool for the website. Enabling file uploads is a critical business requirement for the user.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: Potentially blocked by the user's Formspree subscription tier.

**In progress Task List**:
- There are no other in-progress tasks. The sole focus is on resolving the contact form functionality.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no upcoming or future tasks requested by the user.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Extensive Content Updates:** Successfully updated descriptions, FAQs, and keywords for numerous categories (Motor, Elektrik, Kupplung, Karosserie, Antrieb, Klima, Sonstige) across all four languages (DE, EN, HU, PL) in the relevant mock data files.
- **Manufacturer Logo Integration:**
  - Added new manufacturer logos for IWIS, Sonax, and Eurolube.
  - Updated logos for Sachs (to be larger), Bosch, Arnott, and Osram.
  - Updated product categories for existing manufacturers like Bosch and Liqui Moly.
  - All changes were applied to .
- **Complete Reversion of Backend Implementation:**
  - Successfully removed the Vercel Serverless Function ( and dependencies).
  - Successfully removed all SMTP logic, endpoints, and credentials from the Python backend (, ).
  - Rewrote and reverted  to be a purely static Formspree form.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - Issue 1: The root cause of the contact form problem — the user's Formspree account not supporting file uploads on the free plan — has not been resolved. The agent reverted the code back to using Formspree without confirming if the user upgraded their plan, meaning the original problem will almost certainly persist.
     - Debug checklist: The next agent must immediately test the file upload via the Formspree form and, upon the expected failure, clearly communicate the reason (plan limitation) to the user and state that a Formspree upgrade is the only path forward for that solution.
     - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? To stop the cycle of implementing non-viable solutions and provide the user with a clear, actionable path to achieve their goal.
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Frontend
     - Is recurring issue? Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - Not applicable.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Form Handling:** Formspree ( hook)
- **Content Management:** Static JavaScript objects for multi-language support (i18n).
- **Deployment Target:** Vercel (as a static site).

**key DB schema**
- No database is in use.

**changes in tech stack**
- The stack was temporarily expanded to include a **FastAPI** backend and then a **Node.js** Vercel Serverless Function.
- This has been **fully reverted**. The project is now a pure static React application with no active backend component.

**All files**
- **Created and subsequently deleted:**
  -  & : Files for the Vercel Serverless function.
  - : A temporary guide for the user.
- **Significantly updated:**
  - : Updated with new German content for multiple categories.
  - , : Updated with translated content.
  - : Added and updated multiple manufacturer logos and their category associations.
  - : The file was completely rewritten to use Formspree, removing all logic related to fetching from a custom backend.
  - : All email sending endpoints and logic were removed.
  - : All SMTP credentials were removed.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  directory still exists but serves no purpose for the frontend application anymore. For clarity, it could be removed entirely, though it is not causing any harm.

**key api endpoints**
- The application now only communicates with the Formspree endpoint: 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **DO NOT** attempt to build a custom backend solution for the contact form. The user has explicitly requested to revert to Formspree after multiple failed attempts with custom backends.
- The core problem is that the user's Formspree plan likely does not support file uploads. This was the original reason for the deviation. Your first step should be to test the file upload functionality and confirm if it fails.
- If the upload fails, you must clearly explain to the user that they need to upgrade their Formspree plan. Do not suggest alternative technical solutions unless the user rejects the Formspree upgrade path.

**documents created in this job**
- None remain.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1. **User Request:** Change the website and form submission email to  and asks for required SMTP details.
2. **User Clarification:** Provides Checkdomain SMTP details but asks if forwarding from Gmail is possible without sharing the new password.
3. **User Update:** Reports that forwarding failed and requests the form to be re-programmed using the provided Checkdomain SMTP credentials and password.
4. **User Instruction:** Provides detailed, technical instructions to abandon the Python backend and implement a Vercel Serverless Function () for mail sending, explaining the limitations of the preview environment vs. live deployment.
5. **User Reversal:** Instructs the agent to **undo all backend and serverless changes** and revert the contact form completely to a static implementation using Formspree ().

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The contact form's file upload capability is almost certainly non-functional due to the likely limitations of the user's Formspree plan. This is a critical regression to the original problem state.
- **Mocked:** N/A

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: [The file upload feature in the contact form has been reverted to a state that was previously confirmed to be non-functional.]

**Credentials to test flow:**
- Formspree Endpoint: 
- The following credentials are now **DEPRECATED** and should **NOT** be used:
    - Checkdomain SMTP Host: 
    - Checkdomain SMTP User: 
    - Checkdomain SMTP Pass: 

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent failed to confirm with the user if they had upgraded their Formspree plan before undertaking the significant work of reverting the entire backend. This was a critical oversight and means the agent likely spent time implementing a solution that will fail for the exact same reason as it did initially.
- The agent has not performed a final end-to-end test on the reverted Formspree form to confirm its submission status, leaving the task in an unverified state.</analysis>
