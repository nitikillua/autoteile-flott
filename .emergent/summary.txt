The AI engineer successfully progressed the  landing page through several iterations. Initially, the focus was on implementing a conversion-optimized frontend, integrating Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and mock data for multi-language support. Significant achievements include: implementing a 12-category system with detailed modals, full multi-language support (DE, EN, HU, PL), and a GDPR-compliant cookie banner. The contact mechanism evolved from direct calls to WhatsApp, then to a detailed contact form using Formspree.

Challenges involved refining multi-language content, adapting UI elements, and meticulously verifying changes through screenshots. The engineer efficiently handled iterative feedback such as custom logo integration, company details updates, and complex content organization. The work concluded with a major effort to integrate manufacturer logos into category detail modals, including a crucial phase of correcting category-to-manufacturer mappings and iteratively collecting and integrating missing logos from the user. The current state is actively integrating the last batch of manufacturer logos.

The user aims to develop a conversion-optimized, agency-quality landing page for Autoteile Flott, an auto parts consultation service. The core problem is to generate user engagement and inquiries through a modern, responsive, and intuitive website.

The application started as a frontend-only MVP with multi-language support (DE, EN, HU, PL), featuring a hero, categories, about, contact, and footer sections. Key design elements included Shadcn UI, glass-morphism effects, and clear CTAs.

Subsequent requirements included:
- Branding: Integrate AUTOTEILE FLOTT logo, update company address (Friedrich-Schüle-Straße 12, 85622 Feldkirchen), and email (flott.autoteile@gmail.com).
- Contact Evolution: Initially direct phone/WhatsApp, later transitioning to a generic Kontakt button scrolling to a detailed contact form with fields for Name, E-Mail (required), Telefon/WhatsApp, HSN (4-digit, required)/TSN (3-digit, required) with help image, Textfeld, and optional Attachment, powered by Formspree.
- Categories: Expansion to 12 categories, each with a Kontakt CTA and a Weiterlesen button to open a modal with SEO text, images, FAQs, and key parts. Desktop layout to be a 3x4 grid; mobile remains progressive.
- Legal & Compliance: Create clickable Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB pages. Remove all Emergent branding. Implement a GDPR-compliant cookie banner.
- Manufacturer Logos: Integrate manufacturer logos into the SEO text section of  under a Unsere Partner-Hersteller section, ensuring uniform sizing and correct category mapping. Logos are sourced from the user or found online.

The AI engineer is currently in the process of integrating manufacturer logos into the . This involves dynamically displaying a Unsere Partner-Hersteller section within the modal, showing relevant logos for the active category.

The work has been iterative:
1.  **Initial Integration:**  was created, and  was modified to render the logos.
2.  **Mapping Correction:** After user feedback, it was identified that initial category mappings for manufacturers were incorrect based on the provided Word document. A  file was created with revised, accurate mappings (e.g., Schmierstoff/Motoröl mapped to Öl und Filter instead of Sonstige), and then it replaced the original .
3.  **Logo Collection & Integration:** The user is providing missing manufacturer logos in batches of 5, which the AI engineer is integrating one by one into . Many logos have been successfully integrated, significantly reducing the number of text-fallback logos.

As of the end of the trajectory, 5 logos were just integrated (BOSCH, Lesjöfors, Continental, Lemförder, Kolbenschmidt), and a list of 6 manufacturers (Corteco, Dayco, Elring, Febi, Imasaf, Nissens) still have missing logos that the user needs to provide. The  file is the central point for all manufacturer data.
